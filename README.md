# Real time air quality prediction

The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model for real-time air pollution detection using images. We began by gathering data from various sources and improving the quality of low-resolution images through image enhancement techniques. Subsequently, we trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on these images to assess air pollution by evaluating the clarity of the sky depicted in them. Our model implementation utilized the Inception V3 architecture. Following rigorous testing, we deployed the CNN model onto an Android application for practical use.
